===============================

A simple way to generate component classes for assets later used in [openfl](http://www.openfl.org/)


## jsfl files

**[OpenFl] Generate Component Classes.jsfl**

Find all library items with class definitions that don't have class files and create the class files complete with imports and references for clips on the timeline.


**[OpenFl] Auto Flash Class.jsfl**

Add a Linkage class (path) and (if needed) baseclass to the library items, name of class is based upon folder structure in the library of the FLA




## Installing JSFL Scripts

Find your Flash configuration folder:

**On the Mac**: Navigate to `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Flash CC/en_US/Configuration/`

**On the PC**: Navigate to boot drive `\Program Files\Adobe\Flash CC\en_US\Configuration\`

Locate the `Commands` folder and copy your JSFL script in there.
Go back to Flash, and look in the Commands menu. You should see your new script show up in there.
